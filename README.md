# Fundamentals of Programming with Python elective - Rotterdam School of Management 
I decided to take this course to learn more about Python. 
I ended up spending hours a day before the start of the course learning about Computer Science and how programming works. 

## Why am I sharing my assignments? 
Why not? 
Although the "problems" to be solved in those assignments are very basic, I think we all start somewhere. 
I might have more advanced skills than what my assignments require, if a beginner one day stumbles on my assignments which might help them in their learning path, I would be very happy. 

## Why do I learn Python? 
I have a Bachelor of Science in Communication and Media frm Erasmus University Rotterdam.. I conducted a quantitative research for my Bachelor's thesis to investigate the field of perfume advertising. I used SPSS to conduct my analysis.

I am currently finishing up my Master of Science in Marketing Management in the Rotterdam School of Management. 
In the beginning of my Master's, we were introduced to the statistical programming language R. It revived my interest in coding. I also had fun to have some contact with mathematics again. 

I am currently working on my Master's thesis. I'm conducting research on the effect of Nudging on sustainable fashion consumption. I'll be using R to conduct my analysis. 

This focus on quantitative research and the few courses I had during my Master's made me increasingly interested in Data Science and Analysis. Hence, the reason why I'm learning Python. 

## What's my goal? 
I would like to work in the field of Data. Something in Data Analysis in combination to Marketing Analytics would be cool. 
My primary goal, however, is to become really great at handling data and understanding computer science; doing analysis, building models, etc.
